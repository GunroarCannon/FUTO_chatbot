# FUTO Chatbot

The **FUTO Assistant** is a specialized, context-aware chatbot designed to provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO). It serves as the official digital guide for prospective and current students, offering detailed information on academic programs, departmental structure, and campus services.

## Key Features

* **FUTO Academic Programs:** Contains an internal, definitive database of all Schools and Departments (e.g., SICT, SEET, SAAT) to ensure accurate program information, overriding general search results when academic structure is queried.
* **Generative AI Core:** Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for fast, accurate, and conversational responses.
* **Search Grounding:** Integrates Google Search to access real-time, time-sensitive information such as current cut-off marks, registration deadlines, and admission requirements.
* **Context Injection:** Utilizes a robust system prompt to enforce a specific identity and behavioral protocol, ensuring the assistant adheres strictly to official FUTO information and maintains a consistent tone.
* **Single Source of Truth:** Implements a Hierarchy of Authority to resolve conflicting data, prioritizing the pre-defined internal academic structure over external search results.

## Technology Stack

The application is built using a modern, efficient, and secure stack:

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Provides the user interface for chat interaction. |
| **Backend** | Node.js / Express | Serves the static index.html file and handles API requests. |
| **AI Model** | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash | The primary large language model for generating responses. |
| **API** | Generative Language API | Handles all interactions with the Gemini model, including search grounding. |
| **Deployment** | Render | Hosts the full-stack Node.js application. |

## Architecture Note



The entire web application operates from a single Node.js server (`index.js`). This server is responsible for two primary functions:

1.  **Static Serving:** Delivering the frontend client (`index.html`).
2.  **API Endpoint:** Hosting the `/chat` endpoint, which securely handles user queries, injects the necessary FUTO context, executes the search-grounded Gemini API calls, and returns the response to the client.
